Then, you can set up GitHub in Xcode by following this tutorial: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-use-github-with-xcode11-8a93b64ff1bc 

After you have the project on your computer, open terminal and change to the project directory and type "pod install"

Upon successful pods installation, open the workspace file and the project should build and run
